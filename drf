Afternoon everyone! I've reviewed your code above, and wanted to add some additional work. You can ignore that catalog-info.yaml addition as the last step. In review with the CDC earlier, we determined that would not be prioritized immediately
This week, you need to have a minikube cluster up by end of week. https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/ 
minikube start
minikube is local Kubernetes
You'll need kubectl as well https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/
Install and Set Up kubectl on macOS
Before you begin You must use a kubectl version that is within one minor version difference of your cluster. For example, a v1.29 client can communicate with v1.28, v1.29, and v1.30 control planes....
You do not need Docker desktop - https://podman.io/docs/installation can be used for the container engine. You'll need to specify podman as part of your minikube config
Podman Installation | Podman
Looking for a GUI? You can find Podman Desktop here.
Once you've got everything installed, you'll need to confirm everything is operational with https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/
Run a Stateless Application Using a Deployment
This page shows how to run an application using a Kubernetes Deployment object.
Objectives Create an nginx deployment. Use kubectl to list information about the deployment. Update the deployment. B...
If you are running on WSL - the networking stack will break if you're on VPN. It's a known issue. You'll need to be off VPN for your cluster to work
